# Custom Text-to-Image Fine-Tuning using LoRA

This project demonstrates parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion v1.5 using LoRA adapters on a custom dataset.

## What I Did

- Built custom image-caption dataset (cars and pets)
- Converted dataset into structured CSV format
- Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion v1.5 using LoRA
- Applied LoRA to UNet attention layers
- Used mixed precision training
- Generated domain-specific images after training

## Results
